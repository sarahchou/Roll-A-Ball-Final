# Roll-A-Ball-Final
IT TOOK US SEVERAL HOURS TO CREATE OUR FIRST UNITY GAME, BUT BOY DID WE HAVE FUN. ROLL A BALL IS A SIMPLE GAME USING THE GAME ENGINE, UNITY. THE PLAYER MUST NAVIGATE A BALL USING THE ARROW KEYS THROUGHOUT THE PLANE AND COLLECT A SERIES OF ROTATING CUBES. DON’T WORRY ABOUT FALLING OFF THE PLANE - THE STURDY WHITE WALLS WILL BLOCK YOUR EVERY ATTEMPT TO COMMIT SUICIDE! THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO COLLECT ALL 13 CUBES, AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, A GRAND OLE “YOU WIN!!!” TEXT APPEARS. YUP!
